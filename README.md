- 👋 Hi, I’m @infection-tag
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Dev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing.
- 📫 How to reach me turn ten blocks to the right, and ask the man at the door for a lump of sugar and 2 scoopes of butter. Don't be alarmed when he takes you. You will wake up, bindfold removed, sitting in front of me.
